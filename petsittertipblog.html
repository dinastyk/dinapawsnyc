    <div class="blog-post">
      <h3>1. Have a Meet and Greet</h3>
      <p>
        Even a quick 30-minute meeting in person can help ensure you’re choosing the right person for your pets while you’re away.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Pay Attention to Questions Asked (or Lack Thereof)</h3>
      <p>
        Experienced pet sitters will ask important questions about medications, triggers, routines, and other needs. It’s a good sign when they’re thorough.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Ask Them Questions!</h3>
      <p>
        I was once asked during a meet and greet, “How do you handle emergency situations with pets?” It was a fantastic question.
        Just the day before, a pet I was watching had stomach issues. I explained how I located nearby vets in advance, called the pet parents to confirm,
        and got the pet the care it needed without surprises on their vet bill.

      <p>
        Happy pet sitter searching! I'm always happy to take care of all pet care needs in NYC and Jersey City.
